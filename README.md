We proceed to generate our Teams. In this particular project our Team name is Online Banking. Afterwards we proceed to create our agents and users. Two agents were created which are assigned a different department. Jane Doe was assigned to SysAdmin Department and John Doe was assigned to Support Department. Lastly, our end users are generated for full functionality and even create their own tickets.

Lastly, our project concludes with the generation of our SLA's and help topics. We created three separate SLA's, each varying in severity. The the screenshot above displays the first SLA entitled SEV-A, which has the highest priority having a grace period of one hour and schedule 24/7. As our final task, five Help Topics were created for end users to toggle through to create a ticket. The Help topics are:
Business Critical Outage /
Personal Computer Issues /
Equipment Request /
Password Reset /
Other
